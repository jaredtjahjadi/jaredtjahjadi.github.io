                    My name is Jared Tjahjadi. Born and raised in Queens, NY, I graduated from Stony Brook University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Now, I work as an Associate Modeling & Simulation Engineer at MITRE. My main coding languages are Java, JavaScript, and Python.
                    <br /><br />
                    In my free time, I enjoy listening to pop, rock, or rap music, going to the gym, and taking walks. On campus, I was the President of the Pokemon GO Club and the Co-Head Activities Coordinator of the Science Fiction Forum!
